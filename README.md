# JavaScript - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). Need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 

You can handle this... right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

## Your Task

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  
* Used a date form in the HTML document and JavaScript code that listens for events and searchs through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 


* Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
